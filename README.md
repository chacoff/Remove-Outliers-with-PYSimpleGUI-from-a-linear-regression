# Remove-Outliers-with-PYSimpleGUI-from-a-linear-regression

Using PYSimple GUI based in the widget from @SuperMechaDeathChrist; plt_figure_w_controls.py https://github.com/SuperMechaDeathChrist/Widgets

I modified it in order i can load my own csv, plot them and remove the outliers only with one click. For the moment is deleting one by one, but soon i'll modify to select all what you want and then delete these.

Requirements:
- pysimplegui v.4.29.0
- tkinter v.8.6.8
- matplotlib v.3.1.3
- numpy v.1.18.1
- os
- csv
