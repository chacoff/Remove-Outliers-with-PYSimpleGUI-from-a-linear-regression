# Remove-Outliers-with-PYSimpleGUI-from-a-linear-regression
Using PYSimple GUI based in the widget from SuperMechaDeathChrist; plt_figure_w_controls.py https://github.com/SuperMechaDeathChrist/Widgets

I modified in order i can load my own csv, plot them and remove the outliers only with one click
for the moment is deleting one by one, but soon i'll modify to select all what you want and then delete these
